# irrBAW-test
Getting hands dirty and testing out irrBAW :P

Simple examples that reflect basic graphic principles instead of going in-depth like default example_tests

# Want to test it out yourself?
Simple ~ 
1. Create a folder whatever you want to name it in example_tests and add one of the .cpp files
2. Edit CMakeLists.txt at IrrlichtBAW/example_tests and add 
```add_subdirectory(YOUR_FOLDER_NAME_HERE EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)```
3. Copy-Paste one of the CMakeLists.txt in the example_tests folder to the folder you made
4. Configure/Generate IrrlichtBaw/CMakeLists.txt
Good to go! :)
